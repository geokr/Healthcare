Healthcare is a small data mining project, with the goal of analysing a dataset, dealing with missing values and predicting the event of a stroke based on the data from the dataset.

**Task 1**
Analyse the healthcare dataset and find the columns with the missing values.


**Task 2**
Deal with the missing values using the methods below,
1) Drop column
2) Fill misiing values with the mean
3) Fill the missing values using Linear Regression
4) Fill the missing values using K-Nearest Neighbours.


**Task 3##
Create a model using the Random Forest Classifier with the train-test analogy (75%-25%), to predict a stroke. Review the results using the performance metrics (f1-score, precision, recall).
